# Lane-Detection
- This is a Computer Vision project targeted to detect lane on street images.                                                            
- Also involves some basics of CV such as blurring, detecting edges.<br /> Note: [Images](https://github.com/S-h-a-s-h-a-n-k/Lane-Detection/tree/main/Code/images) used are uploaded in [Code](https://github.com/S-h-a-s-h-a-n-k/Lane-Detection/tree/main/Code) folder.
